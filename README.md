Tina Peters, a prominent election denier and Republican Mesa County Clerk and Recorder, has raised more money since losing the Republican primary for Secretary of State than she had going into the election.

9Wants to Know found approximately 3,023 donors gave $234,196.46 from January 1, 2022 through June 28, 2022.

But from June 29, 2022 to July 27, 2022 roughly 5,393 donors gave an additional $503,649. One resident of South Pasadena, California, topped the list with $1,500 but the typical donation stayed at $50.

72% of money donated from June 23, 2022 to July 27, 2022 came from outside of Colorado. 4,439 donations totaling $370,268.29 from out of state came into Petersâ€™ coffers in the days leading up to and following her primary loss. There were dozens of donations in the days leading up to the Colorado primary on June 28, but most of the money came in late July.
